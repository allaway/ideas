# ideas
I have a lot of dumb ideas for projects, but maybe some of them are occasionally good ideas or actionable in the right hands. Here's a running list. 

If you happen to stumble upon this repo and are interested in collaborating on one or more of these projects, let me know!

If you are not interested in collaborating (totally fine) but are planning on working on one of these projects, please [file an issue so](https://github.com/allaway/ideas/issues/new) I can mark it off as in progress.

automate manual compound curation|get a bunch of medicinal chemists in a room to rate structures and then develop predictive models using the ratings as training data. It seems like the manual process of triaging molecules is unavoidable even when using ADME tools. Could we develop computational methods to resolve that manual curation step??||
