# ideas
I have a lot of dumb ideas for projects, but maybe some of them are occasionally good ideas or actionable in the right hands. Here's a running list. 

If you happen to stumble upon this repo and are interested in collaborating on one or more of these projects, let me know!

If you are not interested in collaborating (totally fine) but are planning on working on one of these projects, please [file an issue so](https://github.com/allaway/ideas/issues/new) I can mark it off as in progress.

----|----|----|----
automate manual compound curation|get a bunch of medicinal chemists in a room to rate structures and then develop predictive models using the ratings as training data. It seems like the manual process of triaging molecules is unavoidable even when using ADME tools. Could we develop computational methods to resolve that manual curation step??||
automate manual dose-response curation|get a bunch of preclinical researchers to categorize dose response curves for activity (i.e. efficacious compounds, non efficacious compounds to train a model to predict the efficacy of any given curve. There is often a lot of manual curation and triaging that goes on - 4/5 parameter logistic regression is not the be-all and end all of determining whether a compound is efficacious||
NF1 tumors - viral integration?|run a method like [p-dip](https://github.com/mzapatka/p-dip) on WGS data, or another appropriate method on RNA-seq data||
NF symptom tracking app|measure pain, tumor burden, medication, diet, sleep; could generate important research data while providing value to patients||
